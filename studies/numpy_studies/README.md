# NumPy Studies 🧮

This repository documents my notes in learning **NumPy**.

## 🚀 Key Concepts Covered
- **Array Creation:** transforming lists into arrays and creating manual arrays (`np.array`).
- **Inspection:** Understanding array dimensions with `.shape`.
- **Generation:** Creating sequences with `np.arange` (start, stop, step).
- **Initialization:** creating empty or filled matrices using `np.zeros` and `np.full`.
- **Indexing:** Accessing specific elements within an array.

## 🛠️ Requirements
- Python 3.x
- NumPy (`pip install numpy`)
