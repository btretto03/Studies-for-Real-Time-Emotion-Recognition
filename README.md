# Real-Time Emotion Recognition System using OAK Cameras
*This project is developed as part of an Undergraduate Research program advised by Prof. Dr. Josue J. G. Ramos.*

## 📄 About the Project

This repository documents the development of an **Undergraduate Research** project focused on **Affective Computer Vision**. The main objective is to develop and integrate a system capable of detecting human emotions in real-time, utilizing Deep Learning models optimized for GPU execution and OAK smart cameras.

## 🎯 Objectives

The project is divided into three strategic phases:
1. **Model Selection and Optimization:**
2. **Hardware Integration (OAK):**
3. **Experimental Validation:**

## 🛠️ Methodology

The adopted methodology follows a flow of incremental complexity:

* **Preliminary Studies (Kaggle):**
* **Hardware Familiarization:**
* **Pipeline Implementation:**
* **Integration:**

## 🚀 Technologies Used

* **Language:** Python
* **AI Frameworks:** PyTorch
* **Hardware:** OAK-D Camera, GPU (CUDA)

## 📈 Expected Results

By the end of the project, the goal is to deliver a functional emotion recognition system using a camera, documented and experimentally validated regarding its capability to operate in real-time.
