Mathematical Analysis, it counts how many images exist in each category and plots a Bar Chart, the AI might struggle to learn it, the output is the statics.txt

## 🚀 How to Run
This code is for **Kaggle Kernels**.
1. Upload the scripts (`.py`) to a Kaggle Notebook.
2. Add the **FER-2013** dataset.
3. Run the cells to generate the plots.
